## Summary
While there more rides and drivers in urban cities, the rural cities are more profitable on average. Urban cities have the highest revenue when it comes to total fare.

### Three business recommendations 

- The demand for rides in rural and suburban cities are more than then drivers in these two cities. Given the average fare per ride in these cities is higher than urban cities, I would recommend to provide more drivers to rural and urban cities.

- Urban cities have more drivers than rides, I would recommend on providing more incentives to increase rides in these cities. Currently, Urban cities have the highest revenue, but if we provide more incentives to the riders, and increase the number of riders then, urban cities, fares might be even higher.

- I would also recommend to collect data of distance travelled in each of these cities and determine the average fare per km travelled. This can be used to understand which cities riders travels the furthest. Longer the ride the more profitable the ride will be. Based on this new data we can determine which city to focus furthermore.
